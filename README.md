Antonin's Dotfiles
==================

To get started, you can use this one line installer:

```sh
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abruneau/dotfiles/master/install.sh | sh
```

## Updating setup

If you made changes to your Dotfiles and want to apply it to another system, pull the new version and apply it.

```sh
cd ~/.dot
git pull
./run
```
